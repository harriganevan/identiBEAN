# identiBEAN
identiBEAN is a dry bean identifying tool

Trained with the data of 13611 dry beans from 7 different classes (Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz and Sira), the model can take in an image and provide a prediction as to which class the provided bean belongs to.

The example folder provides two examples of different bean image inputs and the progam outputs.
